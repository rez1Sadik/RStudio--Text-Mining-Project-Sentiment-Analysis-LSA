## Introduction

Maintaining a competitive edge in the earphone market requires effective customer relations management, and customer feedback is crucial for business development and success.

The aim of this project is to exhibit my text mining skills on _Amazon Earphone Customer Reviews_ dataset on **Rstudio**. 


## Data Source 
I have used the data available at Kaggle website (_[Amazon Earphones Reviews, 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shitalkat/amazonearphonesreviews)_). The dataset fulfils the requirements for the project and is in the CSV format.


## Problem Statement
**PTron Intunes** wants to investigate the major factors influencing customers' delight and disappointment with their product (_earphones_) to stay competitive. 

The project issues are divided into 2 stages. 

**#1.** Measuring the consumer sentiment accurately by **sentiment analysis**.

**#2:** Figuring out the major factors for consumer sentiements by using topic modelling (**LSA**).
